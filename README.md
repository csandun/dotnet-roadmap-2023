# dotnet-roadmap-2023

It's the end of 2022 and coming to a new year in your career. Many developers stay in their comfort zone with CRUD operations and basic development technologies. It is time to move with new Dotnet technologies and current industry trends and challenges in 2023. Moving with new Dotnet technologies I created a .net developer roadmap with inspiration from [NickChapsas(@nickchapsas)](https://twitter.com/nickchapsas?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
"My ideas entirely propose this roadmap; anyone can agree or disagree with me. Also open to suggestions for this."

I plan to share these technologies in the upcoming year, 2023, via my blogs. Keep in touch with [csandunblogs.com](csandunblogs.com) and my LinkedIn.
